Tiling Window Manager in Python
=====

**Qtile is a full-featured, hackable tiling window manager written in Python**

* Simple, small and extensible. It's easy to write your own layouts, widgets
  and built-in commands.
* Configured entirely in Python.
* Command-line shell that allows all aspects of Qtile to be manipulated and inspected.
* Complete remote scriptability - write scripts to set up workspaces, manipulate
  windows, update status bar widgets and more.
* Qtile's scriptability has made thorough unit testing possible, making it one
  of the best-tested window managers around.

Since one of Qtile's aims is to stay out of your way, there's usually not much
to show off in a screenshot. That said, here's an image showing some of Qtile's
built-in widgets in bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Click for very
large version:
